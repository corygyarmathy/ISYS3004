            While I accomplished the main aspects of the website, I have
            realised that I got too caught up in the formatting of the base
            page. I spent too long trying to understand the display and flex
            modes, and while I made slow progress, it meant that I did not have
            time for some of the core functionality, such as getting the contact
            page working.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think it was mostly attempting to get the page smoothly working as
            the resolution changed which absorbed too much of my time. I found
            that it was immensely challenging to make the elements adjust
            exactly as I wanted them to. I also found that introducing new css
            to the parent container could fundamentally affect how all the
            children behaved, and I was often causing two problems every time I
            attempted to fix one.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up deploying the website through Netlify by integrating with
            GitHub. While it took me a bit to get working, the almost immediate
            feedback after I pushed to my git repo significantly aided me in
            diagnosing small problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am already familiar with working with Git, so that was not overly
            challenging. I did somehow manage to create a self-referencing
            submodule in the repository which caused the website builds to fail.
            I did not know about submodules, so while it was annoying the issue
            occurred, it was interesting to learn about.
          </p>

          <p>
            While I understand the general idea of how to combine HTML, CSS, and
            JS, the experience of building a more extensive website has
            reinforced why frameworks are generally utilised. It is increadibly
            tedious and slow to add every new element, and I greatly
            underestimated how long this assignment would require to complete. I
            will keep this in mind for the next 2 assessments I work on for this
            unit.
