/* Floats can be confusing to understand.  The default is a 'vertical flow', from top to bottom,
effectively limiting you to a single column layout.   Changing the width of an element isn't
enough.  Floats allow you to change the flow to 'horizontal flow', so we can put block-level
elements side-by-side. This allows us to build multicolumn pages-grids.

Flexbox is the modern replacement, but floats have been used for over a decad and serve as the
foundation for the majority of website.  As mentioned in lectures, teaching you basic but
critical skills.  Floats hace limited options, making them a little easier learn compared to
Flexbox (and CSS Grid).

Generally we need a combination of floats and width rules. These are 'hints' to the browser
as is builds/renders the page.  Issues can arise with overflow, if enough space available etc.
The best option is to understand the basics, keep the website simple and experiment with
different options. If you want to kow more, here is a good webapge on this:

#featured {
    float: left;  /* start at the left */
    width: 100%;  /* take up the complete 'row' */

#content {
    float: left;
    width: 65%;

#extras {
    float: right;
    width: 20%;

#extras h2 {
    padding: 5px;

    background-color: #eee;

#extras p {
    font-size: 50%;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: normal;
}

/* When we reach the footer, we are pretty much done/finished with our side-to-side flow
and want to return to the defualt vertical flow.  To do this we 'clear' the flow, that is
when we tell the block-element to ignore any floats that appear before.  So instead of flowing
around the floated box, it now appears after the box.  That is we have "force" back to the
default vertical flow. */
footer {
    clear: both; /* change back to vertical flow (default) */
